  Tow Surfed "Jaws" <span>2009</span> </h2>
<p id="content7">
  Tow surfing is a form of surfing that uses artificial help in order to surf faster and larger waves, as paddling by hand would make catching these waves almost impossible. The “Jaws Wave” is located in Peʻahi Hawaii and holds the record for the largest
  wave surfed at 66 feet tall surfed by Makua Rothman. Bethany Hamilton tow surfed Jaws at age 19, her wave coming in at around 40 feet tall (roughly 8 times the height of the average person); this wave has since been one of the biggest of her career
  and pushed her even further into the limelight. </p>
