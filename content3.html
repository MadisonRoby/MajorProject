  Bethany's Return to Surfing <span>November 26th, 2003</span> </h2>
<p id="content3">
  After the loss of her arm and around a month to recover, Bethany returns to surfing in late November, learning to live her life with her missing arm. Loss of an appendage like an arm or leg can affect peopleâ€™s ability to balance and walk in a straight
  line which could make surfing, a sport that relies heavily on balance, an extremely difficult task especially after only a month of time to recover. Her swiftness to return to the ocean is a testament to her love for the sport.
