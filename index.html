    Bethany Hamilton
  </h1>
  <h2>
    Bethany Hamilton was born in Lihue Kauai on February 8, 1990 to a family of surfers who had her on a board from a young age. After being attacked by a tiger shark and losing her arm, Bethany went on to become an accomplished surfer, winning national championships,
    writing a book which later was adapted into a movie, and advocating and inspiring those who have also lost or were born without apendages like arms or legs.

        Shark Attack <span>October 31st, 2003</span>
        <p>
          While surfing in Kauai at 13 years old, Bethany Hamilton was attacked by a tiger shark, one of the most aggressive species of shark, and lost both her arm and almost two-thirds of her blood. The bite was so clean that Bethany noticed the color of the
          water before the loss of her arm which likely aided in her recovery.
          <br>
          <br> <span>Shark Fact: Tiger sharks are considered the most dangerous species of shark on the planet due to their willingness to attack humans unprovoked. Tiger sharks can grow to 18 feet (5.5 m) long and 2,000 pounds (900 kg).</span>

        Bethany's Return to Surfing <span>November 26th, 2003</span>
        <p>
          After the loss of her arm and around a month to recover, Bethany returns to surfing in late November, learning to live her life with her missing arm. Loss of an appendage like an arm or leg can affect people’s ability to balance and walk in a straight
          line which could make surfing, a sport that relies heavily on balance, an extremely difficult task especially after only a month of time to recover. Her swiftness to return to the ocean is a testament to her love for the sport.

        Tow Surfed "Jaws" <span>2009</span>
        <p>
          Tow surfing is a form of surfing that uses artificial help in order to surf faster and larger waves, as paddling by hand would make catching these waves almost impossible. The “Jaws Wave” is located in Peʻahi Hawaii and holds the record for the largest
          wave surfed at 66 feet tall surfed by Makua Rothman. Bethany Hamilton tow surfed Jaws at age 19, her wave coming in at around 40 feet tall (roughly 8 times the height of the average person); this wave has since been one of the biggest of her
          career and pushed her even further into the limelight. </p>
