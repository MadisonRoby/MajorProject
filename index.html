    Bethany Hamilton
  </h1>
  <h2>
    Bethany Hamilton was born in Lihue Kauai on February 8, 1990 to a family of surfers who had her on a board from a young age. After being attacked by a tiger shark and losing her arm, Bethany went on to become an accomplished surfer, winning national championships, writing a book which later was adapted into a movie, and advocating and inspiring those who have also lost or were born without apendages like arms or legs.

        Signs First Major Sponsorship Deal <span>1999</span>
        <p>
          Bethany Hamilton and her best friend Alana Blanchard signed a contract with Rip Curl, a popular surfing brand, in 1999 at just age nine. Bethany was scouted while surfing in Hawaii, described by Alana as “aggressive and a really good surfer,” as she competed
          in various surfing competitions.

        Shark Attack <span>October 31st, 2003</span>
        <p>
          While surfing in Kauai at 13 years old, Bethany Hamilton was attacked by a tiger shark, one of the most aggressive species of shark, and lost both her arm and almost two-thirds of her blood. The bite was so clean that Bethany noticed the color of the
          water before the loss of her arm which likely aided in her recovery.
          <br>
          <br> <span>Shark Fact: Tiger sharks are considered the most dangerous species of shark on the planet due to their willingness to attack humans unprovoked. Tiger sharks can grow to 18 feet (5.5 m) long and 2,000 pounds (900 kg).</span>

        Bethany's Return to Surfing <span>November 26th, 2003</span>
        <p>
          After the loss of her arm and around a month to recover, Bethany returns to surfing in late November, learning to live her life with her missing arm. Loss of an appendage like an arm or leg can affect people’s ability to balance and walk in a straight
          line which could make surfing, a sport that relies heavily on balance, an extremely difficult task especially after only a month of time to recover. Her swiftness to return to the ocean is a testament to her love for the sport.

          At age 14, around a year after losing her arm, Bethany wins an ESPY for “Comeback Athlete of the Year” for her return to competitive and casual surfing. This made her one of the youngest athletes to receive such an award and it’s even more impressive
          how soon she received the award after the attack.
