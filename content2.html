  Shark Attack <span>October 31st, 2003</span> </h2>
<p id="content2">
  While surfing in Kauai at 13 years old, Bethany Hamilton was attacked by a tiger shark, one of the most aggressive species of shark, and lost both her arm and almost two-thirds of her blood. The bite was so clean that Bethany noticed the color of the
  water before the loss of her arm which likely aided in her recovery.

  <br> <span>Shark Fact: Tiger sharks are considered the most dangerous species of shark on the planet due to their willingness to attack humans unprovoked. Tiger sharks can grow to 18 feet (5.5 m) long and can weigh up to 2,000 pounds (900 kg).</span>
